# ble-for-iot
This set of slides shows one way BLE-capable devices can be part of Internet.

BLE stands for Bluetooth for low energy.
BLE allows a small device to communicate with a nearby, more capable device.
An Internet-to-BLE gateway is an example of the latter type of device and allows any body on the Internet to communicate a BLE device through a set of WEB APIs.
